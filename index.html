                More than 20 different nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are available 
                commercially,and these agents are used worldwide for their analgesic antipyretic 
                and antiinflammatory effects in patients with multiple medical conditions. 
                NSAIDs, including aspirin, do not generally change the course of the disease 
                process in those conditions, where they are used for symptomatic relief.

                    NSAIDs are typically divided into groups based on their chemical structure 
                    and selectivity: acetylated salicylates (aspirin), non-acetylated salicylates 
                    (diflunisal, salsalate), propionic acids (naproxen, ibuprofen, acetic acids 
                    (diclofenac, indomethacin), enolic acids (meloxicam, piroxicam) anthranilic acids 
                    (meclofenamate, mefenamic acid), naphthylalanine (nabumetone), and 
                    selective COX-2 inhibitors (celecoxib, etoricoxib).

            <article>
                <p>The main mechanism of action of NSAIDs is the inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). 
                    Cyclooxygenase is required to convert arachidonic acid into thromboxanes, prostaglandins, 
                    and prostacyclins.[9] The therapeutic effects of NSAIDs are attributed to the lack of 
                    these eicosanoids. Specifically, thromboxanes play a role in platelet adhesion, 
                    prostaglandins cause vasodilation, increase the temperature set-point in the hypothalamus,
                    and play a role in anti-nociception. </p>

                <p>
                    There are two cyclooxygenase isoenzymes, COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 gets constitutively 
                    expressed in the body, and it plays a role in maintaining gastrointestinal mucosa lining, 
                    kidney function, and platelet aggregation. COX-2 is not constitutively expressed 
                    in the body; and instead, it inducibly expresses during an inflammatory response. 
                    Most of the NSAIDs are nonselective and inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2. However, 
                    COX-2 selective NSAIDs (ex. celecoxib) only target COX-2 and therefore have a 
                    different side effect profile. Importantly, because COX-1 is the prime mediator 
                    for ensuring gastric mucosal integrity and COX-2 is mainly involved in inflammation, 
                    COX-2 selective NSAIDs should provide anti-inflammatory relief without compromising 
                    the gastric mucosa.

                    Most commonly, NSAIDs are available as oral tablets. According to the package insert, 
                    the dosage for the most common over-the-counter NSAIDs are as follows:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Ibuprofen: for 200 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 4 to 6 hours while symptoms persist. 
                        The daily limit for ibuprofen is 1200 mg. 

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Aspirin regular strength: for 325 mg tablets, 
                        1 to 2 tablets every 4 hours, or 3 tablets every 6 hours. 
                        The daily limit for aspirin is 4000 mg.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Naproxen sodium: for 220 mg tablets, 1 to 2 tablets every 8 to 12 hours. 
                        The daily limit for naproxen sodium is 660 mg. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Topical NSAIDs are also available (diclofenac sodium 1.5% topical solution, diclofenac 
                    hydroxyethyl pyrrolidine 1.3% patch, and diclofenac sodium gel 1%). They are most useful 
                    for treating pain due to soft-tissue injuries and osteoarthritis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Specific NSAIDs can also be administered parenterally; for example, intravenous ibuprofen 
                    is available, given as a 30-minute infusion; this can be used as a non-opioid analgesic to 
                    manage pain and can also reduce fever. Trials have shown that using intravenous ibuprofen 
                    and morphine in postoperative adult patients can lower the total use of morphine. 
                    For treating pyrexia, an initial 400mg dose then 400 or 100 to 200 mg every 4 to 6 hours 
                    as needed. For the treatment of pain, 400 to 800 mg, every 6 hours as needed, 
                    is the recommended dose regimen. Ketorolac is also available for parenteral administration.

          <header>Adverse Effects</header>
          <article>
              <p>
                NSAIDs have well-known adverse effects affecting the gastric mucosa, renal system, 
                cardiovascular system, hepatic system, and hematologic system.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Gastric adverse effects</strong> are likely due to the inhibition of COX-1, preventing the creation 
                of prostaglandins that protect the gastric mucosa. The damage is more likely in a patient 
                that has a prior history of peptic ulcers. Since it is COX-1 specific, the use of 
                COX-2 selective NSAIDs is a lower-risk alternative.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Renal adverse effects</strong> are because COX-1 and COX-2 facilitate the production of 
                prostaglandins that play a role in renal hemodynamics. In a patient with normal 
                renal function, inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis does not pose a large problem; 
                however, in a patient with renal dysfunction, these prostaglandins play a greater 
                role and can be the source of problems when reduced via NSAIDs. Complications 
                that can occur include acute renal dysfunction, fluid and electrolyte disorders, 
                renal papillary necrosis, and nephrotic syndrome/ interstitial nephritis.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Cardiovascular adverse effects</strong> can also be increased with NSAID use; these include MI, 
                thromboembolic events, and atrial fibrillation. Diclofenac seems to be the NSAID with 
                the highest reported increase in adverse cardiovascular events.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Hepatic adverse effects</strong> are less common; NSAID-associated risk of hepatotoxicity 
                (raised aminotransferase levels) is not very common, and liver-related hospitalization 
                is very rare. Among the various NSAIDs, Diclofenac has a higher rate of hepatotoxic effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong> Hematologic adverse effects</strong> are possible, particularly with nonselective NSAIDs due to their
                 antiplatelet activity. This antiplatelet effect typically only poses a problem if the patient
                  has a history of GI ulcers, diseases that impair platelet activity 
                  (hemophilia, thrombocytopenia, von Willebrand, etc.), and in some perioperative cases.
              </p>
              <p>
                Other minor adverse effects include anaphylactoid reactions that involve the skin 
                and pulmonary systems, like urticaria and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease.
